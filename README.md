# GitMe

git:me keeps a Github notification timeline of the current notification stream available on your mobile device.

The intention of the project was to migrate a non-trivial C# app to F#. The C# app was built based on a Microsoft template that is feature-complete out of the box in the sense that it covers:
- app lifecycle management
- navigation
- credential storage
- multi-language support
- network access
- local storage
- in app purchase (not implemented in git:me)
- app store management

The project became out of sync with its goal after the C# version was established, partly because of lack of time and partly because this approach is alienating with the F# community efforts on the XAML type provider.
